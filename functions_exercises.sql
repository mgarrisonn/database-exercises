USE employees;

# Update your queries for employees whose names start and end with 'E'.
# Use concat() to combine their first and last name together as a single column in your results.



# For your query of employees born on Christmas and hired in the 90s,
# use datediff() to find how many days they have been working at the company
# (Hint: You will also need to use now() or curdate())
